            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Heare O Heavens, and hearken O Earth, for I have nouriſhed and brought up children, but they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled against me:</hi> Even ſo now it is, and may well be the Mothers: <hi>Heare O yee Heavens, and hearken O Earth! For I have nouriſhed and brought up children, but they have rebelled against me, in ſeeking to deſtroy me, and to bring me to utter ruine and deſolution</hi> Ah woefull Mother of a ſtubborn and diſobedient off-ſpring. How did I ſit as a Queen (rejoycing and ſolacing my ſelfe in the midſt of the Nations) and ſaid, I ſhall ſee no ſorrow? But now (behold) that which I feared not is come upon me, it is come upon me ſuddenly and in a moment, and paines as upon a woman in travell. My lovers and acquaintance begin to forſake me, and ſtand a far off, looking upon my trouble. I am forſaken of mine own chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, even thoſe I brought up upon my breaſts, and dandled upon my knees. Behold therefore if there be any ſorrow like unto my ſorrow, and like unto that, wherein the Lord begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:156120:2"/> to viſit me. Pity me ô my children, ô pity me and let not your fainting and diſconſolate mother, ſinke down betweene your hands. O be not ſo cruell and hard-hearted as by your civill diſcord, by inteſtine war, by ſchiſme, faction and diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to rend and teare out the bowels of your mother! which hath ſo lovingly nurſt &amp; brought you up, ſo tenderly kept you, and <hi>Pelicane</hi> like hath fed you with her own heart bloud, even the bloud of Saints &amp; Martyrs. O make not my ſorrow greater, in deſpiſing of me. I am black, but comely: I am black in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of ſome enormities, miſdemeanors, and imperfections; but comely as the tents of <hi>Kedar,</hi> and as the curtaines of <hi>Salomon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

It is the note of a falſe and erroneous Church, to boaſt its ſelfe of its purity. I confeſſe my fault, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my deformity and deſire to be reformed.

If that which ſhould be my curing, bee my wounding, how great is my miſery. Let the righteous ſmit me, but let not their precious baulme breake my head. Fall not out my deare chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, neither deſtroy your ſelves for the blemiſhes and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of your mother. O give eare and liſten to my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell: leaſt I be conſtrained to call upon the Father of thoſe children, to be a Iudge and a Witneſſe againſt them.</p>
            <p>Give eare and help me, ô my King! for the children are brought to the birth, and there is no ſtrength to bring forth. Dread Soveraign your Nobles and Peeres do ſit in <hi>Parliament,</hi> for a redreſſe &amp; reformation of things; and there is no ſtrength
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:156120:2"/> to bring to paſſe without your Royall conſent. God himſelfe is about a work, a great work, a work of Reformation, tending to his own glory and our good, ô be not you a means to hinder or prevent it, or that that which ſhould be for our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, turn to our utter ruine or deſtruction. Remember that you alſo have a King above you, to whom you muſt give an accompt of all your ways at the laſt day: Reſiſt him not, withſtand no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, leaſt hapily you be found to fight againſt God himſelfe. Remember that you are not only a Defender of the Faith, but alſo that you ſhould be a nurſing Father. O let not poſterity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord you a deſtroyer of your people and Countrey. Let not the frogs of Egypt or the Locuſts of the bottomleſſe pit any longer whiſper in your Royalleares, to ſeduce and deceive you, they croke only for their own advantage, and to bring you and yours back again to the Egyptian bondage, and to Romiſh captivity.</p>
            <p>Give eare and way (dread Soveraigne) to your <hi>Parliament,</hi> and truſty Counſellors, who not only know and are privy to the enormities of the Land, and the diſaſtors of the Kingdom, but alſo are willing to redreſſe and reforme them, having their hearts touched with zeale to Gods glory, love and duty to your Majeſty, care of their Countrey, and ſeeke and indeavour the good and welfare both of Church and Commonwealth. They deſire not to rule, but to be ruled, neither are they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to uſurp ſoveraignity, but to acknowledg you their leidge Lord, they deſire to bring in no innovation, but to reduce the Church and Countrey to their ancient Lawes and Liberty. They indeavour to bring your Majeſties ſubjects to your obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and our Religion to that purity, it was in Chriſt and his Apoſtles time. For this they have humbly ſued to your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for this they ſtrive and contend. They deſire (being Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants) to conforme themſelves to all other Proteſtant-Churches, and not to halt any longer between two opinions: between Chriſt and Beliall, betweene the Truth and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, between <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> or between a <hi>Papiſt</hi> and a
